The first reason is that when we are adopting the floor price in valuing 1), we are being over-conservative as we use the floor price to reflect all assets in the collection, and 2.3) helps to balance this. The second reason is that for any NFT collection that has good liquidity, we may always find newly traded NFTs and for these NFTs the last traded price will better telling the real market value - so this method will perform better with high liquid collections, which is good and intuitive.
